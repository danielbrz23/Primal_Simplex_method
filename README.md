# Two-Phase Primal Simplex Method in Python

This repository contains the implementation of the **Two-Phase Primal Simplex Method** in Python, using the `numpy` library. This project is part of the requirements the **Linear Programming** course at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

## Description

- **Phase 1**: Introduces artificial variables to transform the problem into a feasible form, finding a basic feasible solution.
- **Phase 2**: Solves the original problem starting from the solution obtained in Phase 1.

The code is written in **Python** with the help of the **`numpy`** library, which simplifies matrix and vector operations, essential for the efficient functioning of the algorithm.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Numpy

You can install `numpy` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy
